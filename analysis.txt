Answer: I’ll brief the positives and negatives about the website.
Usability:
Positives:
•	When I explored the website, the menu was clear and easy to use. Everything was labeled well, so I quickly found the services I was looking for.
•	The search function made it easy to find specific content.
•	Contact details were clearly visible for quick access.
Negatives:
•	The navigation menu feels unorganized since all services are listed in one place. Adding dropdowns or categories could make it easier for users to browse.
•	Also there are no clear action buttons that calls out to users like “Book Now” or “Avail us!” which makes it difficult for users to take the next step.
•	Some service pages don’t have enough details, which might leave users unsure about what’s being offered or why they should choose this company.







Design: 
Positives:
•	The clean, minimalist design keeps things simple and free of clutter, making navigation easy.
•	And typography is easy to read, with consistent font choices across all pages.
Negatives:
•	Few high-quality images leave pages feeling text-heavy and less engaging. Adding relevant visuals could improve the overall look.
•	The outdated layout lacks modern design elements, with too much empty space making the site look plain rather than visually appealing also it is advisable to use grids for displaying the images so that multiple images can be shown in a single page.
•	Important details like services and contact information don’t stand out due to poor spacing and layout. A better structure could improve visibility.

Positives:
•	The content is clear and free from unnecessary jargon, making it easy to understand.
